# DD-RSH-CAM (β=1) and RS-DDH (β=¼) vs experiment — EFT-ARPES-bench subset

Two non-empirical dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrids (patched QE 7.5) applied
to a subset of the [EFT-ARPES-bench](https://github.com/kunyuan/EFT-ARPES-bench) set.
Each material runs the same pipeline with **no empirical parameters**:

```
PBE SCF  →  turboEELS ε⁻¹(q)  →  fit (ε∞, μ)  →  hybrid SCF  →  gap
```

Both functionals share the long-range Fock fraction `aexx = 1/ε∞` and the screening
`μ = hfscreen` from the *same* turboEELS fit; they differ only in the **short-range**
Fock fraction `bexx`:

- **DD-RSH-CAM** (Chen 2018): `bexx = 1` — full short-range Fock.
- **RS-DDH** (Skone 2016): `bexx = 0.25` — PBE0-like short-range fraction.

Fock q-grid nqx 6×6×6, `exxdiv = gygi-baldereschi`, SG15 ONCV PBE norm-conserving
pseudopotentials, experimental lattice constants from the bench TOMLs. Because the
dielectric input (ε∞, μ) is PBE-level and functional-independent, RS-DDH reuses the
DD-RSH-CAM fit and only re-runs the final hybrid SCF (`scripts/run_rsddh.sh`).

8 materials, spanning covalent semiconductors, a III-V, alkali halides, and ionic
wide-gap oxide/fluoride.

**DD-RSH-CAM: 8 of 12 edges within tolerance; RS-DDH (β=¼): 8 of 12.**
<!-- END:verdict -->

Both functionals pass **8 of 12 edges**, but on *complementary* materials. DD-RSH-CAM
(β=1) nails the covalent / III-V / chloride edges (Si, C, AlAs, LiCl, NaCl) and
over-opens the small-ε∞ fluorides + oxide (MgO, CaF₂, LiF). Cutting the short-range Fock
to β=¼ (RS-DDH) removes most of that over-opening — MgO +0.72→+0.26, CaF₂ +1.3→+0.2,
LiF +1.70→+0.56, so **MgO and both CaF₂ edges now pass** — but it under-opens the more
covalent direct edges (Si/AlAs Γ→Γ, NaCl). The short-range Fock fraction is the knob that
trades **ionic over-opening (favours β=¼)** against **covalent under-opening (favours
β=1)**.

## What the numbers say

- **Covalent / mid-gap (Si, C, AlAs, LiCl, NaCl): excellent.** All within ≤0.27 eV of
  experiment, essentially on top of G₀W₀ and far better than PBE0's systematic
  over-opening. The non-empirical 1/ε∞ + screened long-range Fock recipe works cleanly
  here, for both indirect (Si, C, AlAs Γ→X) and direct (Γ→Γ) edges.
- **AlAs is a clean two-edge test.** The same single parameter set reproduces *both* the
  indirect X minimum (2.19 vs 2.23) and the Γ direct gap (2.86 vs 3.13), landing right on
  G₀W₀ (2.18 / 2.88) — it is fitting the physics, not one number.
- **LiCl confirms the alkali-halide trend.** Same Li 1s core as LiF but Cl 3p valence and
  a smaller gap: 9.61 vs 9.40 eV, essentially exact and matching DD-PBEH (9.49), where
  HSE06 falls 1.6 eV short.
- **`must_open_gap` passes everywhere.** Every material opens from the PBE value to near
  experiment (NaCl 5.21 → 8.88, LiCl 6.43 → 9.61, C 4.18 → 5.67) without the empirical
  25% mixing of PBE0.
- **The smallest-ε∞ ionic crystals over-open (MgO +0.72, CaF₂ +1.35, LiF +1.70).** As ε∞
  drops (aexx → 0.44–0.49) strict DD-RSH-CAM with full short-range Fock (`bexx = 1`)
  overshoots, monotonically with 1/ε∞. LiF lands on **QSGW (15.9)**, which also overshoots
  before the electron–hole vertex brings it back to ~14.5. This is a real physical trend
  (more screening error where ε∞ is smallest), not a code defect: the PBE0/HSE limits are
  still reproduced bit-for-bit (see `results/MgO-results.md`).
- **RS-DDH (β=¼) is the better choice for these ionic wide-gap crystals.** Reducing the
  short-range Fock to the PBE0-like 0.25 (Skone 2016) brings MgO (8.09), CaF₂ (12.0/12.3)
  and LiF (14.76) back toward experiment — MgO and CaF₂ now pass — confirming the
  over-opening is a *short-range* exchange effect, not the long-range 1/ε∞ tail. The price
  is mild under-opening of the covalent direct edges (Si Γ −0.31, AlAs Γ −0.42, NaCl
  −0.61), where the full short-range Fock of β=1 was doing useful work. No single β is best
  everywhere; the two columns bracket the experimental gaps.
